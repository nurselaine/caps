# caps - The Code Academy Parcel Service

### Problem Domain

  A real-time service that allows for vendors, such as flower shops or restaurants, to alert a system of a package needing to be delivered, for drivers to instantly see whatâ€™s in their pickup queue, and then to alert the vendors as to the state of the deliveries (in transit, and then delivered).

### Phase 1
  - Create event emitters and listeners to notify   
    - Event Handlers: 
      - PICKUP
        - will emit from vendor
        - will listen from server
        - will emit to driver
      - IN-TRANSIT
        - will emit from driver
        - will ALSO emit DELIVERED from driver
        - will listen from server
      - DELIVERED
        - will listen from server
        - will emit to vendor
